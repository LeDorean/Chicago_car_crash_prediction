# Chicago_car_crash_prediction

This repository contains a revisitation of a past project that I worked on during my time at the FlatIron coding bootcamp.

The aim of this project is to evaluate the main causes of car accidents in the Chicago area, using the official reports found on the City of Chicago website.
